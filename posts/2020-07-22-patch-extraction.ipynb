But, the worst part is that the required amount of blur depends on the patch size in the original image, or, in other words, keypoint scale. So for extracting, say 8000 patches, one needs to perform blurring 8000 times. Moreover, if one wants to extract elongated region and warp it to the square patch, the amount of blur in vertical and horizontal directions should be different!\n",
