    "\n",
    "Given the recent success of [OpenAI o3 in ARC Challenge](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough), I decided to check the performace of the currently available `o1` and `4o` models in image matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, asking LLMs to find relative pose or pixel-wise correspondences is pretty stupid (of course, I have tried to do this as well, see the end of this post), that's why I have focused on the simpler classification task -- given two images, tell if they depict covisible areas, or not. \n",

    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",

    "The two images are not completely disjoint; there are some overlapping parts of the stuffed animal visible in both viewpoints. Here's why:\n",

    "Overlapping Parts:\n",
    "- The tail is partially visible in both images, though it is viewed from different angles.\n",
    "- The fur texture on the sides and parts of the body overlaps in both images, though the specific patches might vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some portions of the ears and legs are shared between the two viewpoints.\n",

    "Disjoint Parts:\n",

    "- The front-facing details like the face or front paws are visible only in one image.\n",
    "- The underside or back is featured more prominently in the other image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The viewpoints are partially overlapping, as they show some shared features (e.g., the tail and parts of the body) but also highlight distinct parts of the stuffed animal. This is not a fully disjoint \"different sides of the coin\" scenario.\n",

    "They’re definitely photos of the same building (a distinctive white-and-dark-brick façade with statues and that large clock tower).

    "Yes, there is some overlap. In the second shot (the more diagonal view), you can still see portions of the same façade panels and statues that appear front-and-center in the first photo. They’re just seen from an angle rather than straight on, so there are co-visible areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall I believe, that having a VLM, possibly equipped with access to some low-level SIFT/LightGlue-like instruments is the proper way to handle the image covisibility estimation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to distinguish between photo of the real object and its miniature, or other similar things without more general, semantic understanding of the scene. And the way how ChatGPT handles this, is similar to the way human person would handle it. \n",
