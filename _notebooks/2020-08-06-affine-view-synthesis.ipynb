    "Standard wide-baseline stereo or 3d reconstruction pipelines work well in the many situations. Even if some image pair is not matched, it is usually not a problem. For example, one could match images from very different viewpoints, if there is a sequence of images in between, as shown in Figure below, from \"From Single Image Query to Detailed 3D Reconstruction\" paper\\cite{SingleImage3dRec2015}.\n",

    "However, that might not always be possible. For example, the number of pictures is limited because they historical and there is no way how one could go and take more without inventing a time machine. \n",

    "What to do? One way would be to use [affine features](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2020/07/17/affine-correspondences.html) like Hessian-AffNet\\cite{AffNet2018} or MSER\\cite{MSER2002}. However, they help only up to some extent and what if the view, we need to match are more extreme?\n",

You can think about it as a special version of test-time augmentation, popular nowadays in deep learning. Later affine view synthesis for wide baseline stereo was extended and mathematically justified by Morel & Yu in ASIFT paper\\cite{ASIFT2009}. They proved that perspective image warps are can be approximated by synthetic affine views."

    "## Why does affine synthesis help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite that ASIFT and other view-synthesis based approaches are know more than decade, we are not aware of a study, why does affine synthesis helps in practice. Could one get a similar performance without view synthesis?\n",
    "Specificallly:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. May it be that the most of improvements come from the fact that we have much more features? That is why we fix the number of features for all approaches.\n",
    "1. Some regions from ASIFT, when reprojected to the original image, are quite narrow. Could we get them just by removing edge-like feature filtering, which is done in SIFT, Hessian and other detectors.  Denoted **+edge**\n",
    "2. Instead of doing affine view synthesis, one could directly use the same affine parameters to get the affine regions to describe, so the each keypoint would have several associated regions+descriptors. Denoted **+MD**\n",
    "3. Using AffNet to directly estimated local affine shape without multiple descriptors. Denoted **+AffNet**\n",
    "4. Combine (1), (2) and (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we did the study on HPatches Sequences dataset, the hardest image pairs (1-6) of viewpoint subset. The metric is similar to one used in the \"[Image Matching across Wide Baselines: From Paper to Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01587)\" and CVPR 2020 [RANSAC in 2020](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/cvpr2020-ransac-tutorial/) - mean average accuracy of the estimated homography.\n",

    "\n",
    "We run Hessian detector with RootSIFT descriptor, FLANN matching and LO-RANSAC, as implemented in [MODS](https://github.com/ducha-aiki/mods-light-zmq). Features are sorted according the the detector response and their total number is clipped to 2048 or 8000 to ensure that the improvements do not come from just having more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that we do not study, if view synthesis helps for the regular image pairs - it might actually hurt performance, similarly to [affine features](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2020/07/17/affine-correspondences.html). \n",
    "Instead we are focusing on the case, when view synthesis definitely helps: matching obscure views of the mostly planar scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 8000 feature budget\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are in Figure below. Indeed, all of the factors: detecting more edge-like features, having multiple descriptors or better affine shape improve results over the plain Hessian detector, but even all of the combined are not good enough to match performance of the affine view synthesis + plain Hessian detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the best setup is to use both Hessian-AffNet and view synthesis. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2048 feature budget\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture is a bit different in a small feature budget: neither multiple-(affine)-descriptors per keypoint, nor allowing edge-like feature help. From other hand, affine view synthesis still improves results of the Hessian. And, again, the best performance is achieved with combination of view synthesis and AffNet shape estimation.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Affine view synthesis helps for matching challenging image pairs and its improvement are not just because of more local features used. It can be done effective and efficient -- in the iterative MODS framework.\n"
