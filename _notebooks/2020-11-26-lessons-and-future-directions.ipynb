    "# Lessons learned\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Benchmark = metrics + implementation + dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In our paper \"[Image Matching across Wide Baselines: From Paper to Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01587)\" we focused on the first two parts. Specifically, metrics -- if they are not \"downstream\" metrics, the improvements in the single component might not translate to the overall system improvements. \n",
    "And implementation -- implementing the simplest possible setup is, of course, a valuable tool, but one have to also incorporate the best known practices, e.g. matching, RANSAC tuning as so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope, that we have delivered that message to the community. But the last component -- the dataset -- we have, perhaps, overlooked a bit ourself. The problem with dataset limitations, e.g. lack of illumination or seasonal changes is not that one does not properly address. Usually benchmark papers are adressing their limitations quite clearly.\n",
    "The problem is that researchers (including myself) have tendency to work on improving results, which are easily measurable, therefore the implicitly designing the methods, which solve only some specific problem, encoded in the form of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Trying to work for the \"most general\" case might be detrimental for the practical applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is kind of opposide side of the lesson 1. For example, the classical SIFT matching is rotation-invariant, because that was assumed to be the requirement to work in the \"real world\". However, the practice of image retrieval and then most of learned local features like R2D2, SuperPoint, DELF and so on, showed that \"up-is-up\" is a reasonable assumption to built on. The rotational invariance in lots of scenarios hurt more than helps. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Application-specific local features\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing about the current local features is that they are kind of universal. SIFT works reasonably well for lots of applications: 3d reconstruction, SLAM, image retrieval, etc. The learned features, like SuperPoint or R2D2, although are biased towards the data they are trained on, still don't have anything domain specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain. There are different qualities about the local feature (detectors). It can be more or less robust to nuicance factors like the illumination and camera position. It can be more or less pecisely localized. It can be more or less dense and/or evenly distributed over the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in image retrieval, one does not really care about precise localization, the robustness is much more important. For the 3d reconstruction one would like to have a lot of 3d points to get the reasonable reconstruction.\n",
    "On the other hand, for the SLAM/relocalization application, sparse features would be more advantageous because of smaller memory footprint and computational cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are, actually, some steps in that direction. Let me name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [HOW local features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13172.pdf) designed for the image retrieval\n",

    "## 2. Rethinking overall wide baseline stereo pipeline, optimized for the specific application\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often perceived, that image matching across the unordered collection of the images is a task with quadratic complexity w.r.t. number of images. Some operations can be done separately, e.g. feature detection, but others, like feature matching and RANSAC cannot. Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not necessarily. It turns out, that one can avoid running feature matching and RANSAC for more than 90% of image pairs with clever preprocessing, ordering and re-using results from the previous matching.\n",
    "Moreover, in order to do the whole task faster (matching image collections), one may need to introduce additional steps, which are not necessary, or slowing things down for the two images case.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what we done for the [intial pose estimation for the global SfM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11986) in our paper, which reduced the matching runtime from 200 hours to 29.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another example would be \"[SuperGlue: Learning Feature Matching with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763)\", where authors abandoned traditional descriptor matching and instead leveraged all the information for keypoint and descriptors from both images altogether. "
