    "## Super starts with Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in image matching, you know [SuperPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07629). If you don't - that is one of the most successful modern local feature, developed by Daniel DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz and Andrew Rabinovich in 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea was simple and genious: we know that corners are good keypoints. Let's train a basic corner (in wide meaning) on unlimited synthetic data. Then we somehow adapt it to realworld images.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](2022-12-31-UnsuperPoint-family_files/att_00001.png \"SuperPoint starts with MagicPoint - corner/junctions detector supervised by synthetically rendered cube scenes.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The adaptation is done under augmentation supervision. In other word - we believe that our detector is already good, but noisy and we will cancel this noise by running the same detector on multiple augmented version of the same image, which gives us pseudo-ground truth. \n",
    "The training is done via optimizing cross-entropy loss, which leads to very peaky response map compared to other alternatives such as R2D2. \n",

    "\n",
    "![](2022-12-31-UnsuperPoint-family_files/att_00002.png \"MagicPoint becomes SuperPoint after being finetuned on real images with augmentation supervision.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. The resulting detector (and descriptor) was fast enough on GPU and great for SLAM purposes. It was especially good on indoor images with lots of textureless areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "On outdoor images it was not so great, however, as it was shown later, the problem was more in descriptor and matching, not detector. [SuperGlue matching](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2021/05/14/IMC2020-competition-recap.html) on top of SuperPoint local features won 3 competitions at CVPR 2020, including our [Image Matching Challenge](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2021/05/14/IMC2020-competition-recap.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it was huge success. However, not without drawbacks. The main drawback is that training code was never released. That is why people tried independently re-implement SuperPoint, as well as present new, supposedly better versions of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of this version was properly evaluated, so we have no idea how they work in reality. Let me fill this gap and present a small eval of the SuperPoint children. \n",

Which can increase a precision of the keypoint detector, but not the recall. See the image below for the illustration. The synthetic image at the right clearly benefits, but the realworld image - not so much, because of loosing many keypoints on the ground. \n",
