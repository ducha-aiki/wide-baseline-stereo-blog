    "## Rise of Wide Baseline Stereo\n",
    "\n",
    "The wide baseline stereo (WBS) is a process of establishing correspondences between pixels and/or regions between\n",
    "images depicting the same object or scene and estimation geometric relationship between the cameras, which produced that images.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](00_intro_files/match_doll.png \"Correspondences between two views found by wide baseline stereo algorithm. Photo and doll created by Olha Mishkina\")\n",

    "<!--- ![Wide baseline stereo model. \"Baseline\" is the distance between cameras. Image by Arne Nordmann (WikiMedia)](00_intro_files/Epipolar_geometry.svg) \n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first succesful solutions for the WBS problem was proposed by Schmid and Mohr \\cite{Schmid1995} in 1995.\n",
    "It was later extended by Beardsley, Torr and Zisserman\\cite{Beardsley96} by adding RANSAC robust geometry estimation and later refined by Pritchett and Zisserman \\cite{Pritchett1998, Pritchett1998b} in 1998. The general pipeline remains mostly the same until now \\cite{WBSTorr99, CsurkaReview2018}. The currently adopted version of the wide baseline stereo algorithm is shown below. \n",

    "\n",
    "![](00_intro_files/matching-filtering.png \"Commonly used wide baseline stereo pipeline\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be summarized as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute interest points/regions in all images independently\n",
    "2. For each interest point/region compute a descriptor of their neigborhood (local patch).\n",
    "3. Establish tentative corresponces between interest points based on their descriptors.\n",
    "4. Robustly estimate geometric relation between two images based on tentative correspondences with RANSAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason of steps 1 and 2 done on the both images separately is that in general wide baseline stereo is not limited to pairs of images, but rather to a collections of them. If all the steps are done pairwise, then the computational complexity is $O(n^2)$. The more steps done seperately - the more efficient algorithm is."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012 deep learning-based AlexNet\\cite{AlexNet2012} approach beat all the methods in image classification. Soon after, Razavian et.al\\cite{Astounding2014} have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on the Imagenet outperform more complex traditional solutions in image and scene classification, object detection and image search.\n",
    "Deep learning solutions, be it pretrained or end-to-end learned networks quickly become the default solution for the most of computer vision problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there was still an area, where deep learned solutions failed, sometimes spectacularly: geometry-related tasks. Wide baseline stereo\\cite{Melekhov2017relativePoseCnn}, visual localization\\cite{PoseNet2015}}, SLAM are still areas, where the classical wide baseline stereo dominates\\cite{sattler2019understanding, zhou2019learn}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full reasons why convolution pipelines are failing for geometrical tasks are yet to understand, but the current hypothesis are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNN-based pose predictions predictions are roughly equivalent to retrieval of most similar image from the training set and outputing its pose.\\cite{sattler2019understanding} This phenomenum is also observed in related area: single-view 3D reconstruction\\cite{Tatarchenko2019}.\n",
    "- Geometric and arithmetic operations are hard to represent via vanilla neural networks (i.e. matrix multiplication with non-linearity) and they may require specialized building blocks, resembling operations of algorithmic or geometric methods, e.g. spatial transformers\\cite{STN2015} and arithmetic units\\cite{NALU2018,NAU2020}. Even with special structure such networks require \"careful initialization, restricting parameter space, and regularizing for sparsity\"\\cite{NAU2020}.\n",
    "- Vanilla CNNs are not covariant to even simple geometric transformation like translation \\cite{MakeCNNShiftInvariant2019}, scaling and especially rotation \\cite{GroupEqCNN2016}. Unlike them, WBS baseline is grounded on scale-space theory \\cite{lindeberg2013scale} and local patches are geometrically normalilzed before description. \n",
    "- Predictions of the CNNs can be altered by change in a small localized area \\cite{AdvPatch2017} or even single pixel \\cite{OnePixelAttack2019}, while the wide baseline stereo methods require the consensus of different independent regions. "

    "One of modern revisit of wide baseline stereo ideas is Capsule Networks\\cite{CapsNet2011,CapsNet2017}. Unlike CNNs, they encode not only intensity of feature responce, but also its location and require a geometric agreement between object parts for outputing a confident prediction.\n",
