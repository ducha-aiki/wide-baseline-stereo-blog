    "## The Unbearable Weight of the Bundle Adjustment and $50K money prize\n",
    "\n",
    "This year Image Matching Challenge introduced two big changes. First, we went from two-view matching to full Structure-from-Motion as a task. Actually, the multiview track was present in pre-Kaggle era of IMC -- in [2019](https://image-matching-workshop.github.io/leaderboard/), [2020](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/image-matching-challenge/2020/leaderboard/) and [2021](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/image-matching-challenge/2021/leaderboard/), so we kind of returned to the roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Participants were given with the sets of images and output should be the cameras poses for all of them. \n",
    "Second, thanks to our sponsors -- Google, [Haiper](https://www.haiper.ai), and Kaggle itself, we were able to propose $50k prize fund. With the strict open license condition (MIT/Apache 2/etc) for the \"in-money solution\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D reconstruction is not cheap\n",
    "\n",
    "While going from image pairs to image sets might seem a small change, it has a significant impact on cumpute requirements. For the two-view case, one can run almost everything on GPU, e.g. SuperPoint for feature detection, SuperGlue for image matching, or the LoFTR for detector-less image matching. The only CPU part is the RANSAC, which can take as little as [10ms per image pair for VSAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10240), so not a big deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the multiview case, on the other hand, one needs to performs the bundle-adjustment, which is a CPU-heavy task. Kaggle virtual machines, in addition to that, offer only 2-core CPU, so the 3D reconstruction itself becomes the main computational bottleneck of the whole process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide the participants a headstart, we have worked with Kaggle engineers to include the [pycolmap](https://github.com/colmap/pycolmap) into the default Kaggle kernels. Based on it, we have provided an example submission, which uses local features included in [kornia](link) library: [LoFTR](https://zju3dv.github.io/loftr/), [DISK](https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/disk), and [KeyNet-AffNet-HardNet](https://kornia-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_nbs/image_matching_adalam.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "All of them have Apache 2 license, and has shown a good performance in one of the previous IMCs: LoFTR was a part of [top solutions in 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022/discussion/328854), [recap](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2022/07/05/IMC2022-Recap.html), DISK - in [2020](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/image-matching-challenge/2020/leaderboard/), [recap](https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/2021/05/14/IMC2020-competition-recap.html) and [2021](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/image-matching-challenge/2021/leaderboard/), and KeyNet-AffNet-HardNet - one of the leaders in the [original IJCV-2020 publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01587). \n",

    "### There are no 3d reconstruction libraries besides colmap\n",
    "\n",
    "At least, there are none, which you can easily compile on Kaggle kernel and then use from python notebook. I personally really hoped to see some global SfM solution like [Theia](http://theia-sfm.org) or maybe [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM) to appear among the top-solution,as it could provide a significant speed-up over the incremental SfM like Colmap. \n",
    "Python bindings and ease of compilation is crutial factor here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### No NERF-like or any other solution than classical SfM\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all the progress, it seems that if one doesn't have any additional information, such as RGBD, or initial ARKit cameras poses, the best thing one can do with a challenging image collection, is classical SfM. \n",
    "No [SparsePose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16991), no [FORGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04492)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global descriptor-based co-visibility is hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that exhaistive image matching grows quadratically with number of images, it is very tempting to filter out some of those image pairs, based on some kind of covisibility criterion. And the simplest/fastest to compute is global descriptor one - you get a single vector per image, calculate global image similarity and remove those image pairs, which similarity is below threshold. Or take the top-K most similar images. In fact, I have used such approach in our paper [\"Efficient Initial Pose-graph Generation for Global SfM\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11986). However, what worked on large (thousands) image collections with dense viewpoint coverage, as 1DSfM, does not work that well on sparse image collections with many close-ups, rotations and illumination changes. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many participants has tried to improve the initial SfM camera poses by utilizing [PixelPerfectSfM](https://github.com/cvg/pixel-perfect-sfm) -- the feature-metric bundle adjustment. While it imrpoves results, it took a lot of time and especially memory, which rendered it unpractical for many teams. Another challenge is the package compilation itself, which is not easy either.\n",
